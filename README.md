#### Event Bus

As part of learning microservices and how an async architecture works, I have created a simple event bus using NodeJS in this repository.
The code for event bus implementation is in `index.js` and I intend to add some sample services to this repository in the future that can use this event bus to
communicate to other services.

P.S. Do not try to run any code yet. I will post an update when this system is runnable, so stay tuned!
